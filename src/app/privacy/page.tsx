 <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Account and Registration Data</h3>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-sm mb-4">

 </p>

 <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Usage and Platform Data</h3>

 We collect data about how you use the Service, including log data (IP addresses, browser type, pages visited, timestamps), feature usage, API calls, and Resource Unit consumption. This helps us improve the Service and detect issues.
 </p>

 <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Customer Data</h3>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-sm mb-4">
 We process data that you submit to the Service in the course of your operations — including order details, driver information, vehicle data, customer contacts, and delivery records. This data belongs to you and is processed on your behalf.
 </p>

 <h3 className="font-semibold mb-2">Communications Data</h3>

 <section id="privacy-3">
 <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">3. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
 If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United Kingdom, our legal bases for processing your personal data are:
 </p>
 <ul className="space-y-2 text-muted-foreground text-sm list-disc list-inside">
 <li><strong>Contract performance</strong> — processing necessary to provide the Service under our agreement with you.</li>
 <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — improving the Service, preventing fraud, and communicating about relevant updates.</li>
 <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — complying with applicable laws and regulations.</li>
 <li><strong>Consent</strong> — for marketing communications and optional cookies.</li>
 </ul>
 </section>

 <section id="privacy-4">
 <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-3">
 We do not sell your personal data. We may share your information with:
 </p>
 <ul className="space-y-2 text-muted-foreground text-sm list-disc list-inside">
 <li><strong>Service providers</strong> — trusted third parties who assist us in operating the Service (e.g. cloud infrastructure providers, payment processors, email service providers). These parties are contractually bound to protect your data.</li>
 <li><strong>Business transfers</strong> — in the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you before your data is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
 <li><strong>Legal requirements</strong> — when required by law, court order, or government authority, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fleetbase, our customers, or the public.</li>
 </ul>
 </section>

 <section id="privacy-5">
 <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">5. Data Retention</h2>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
 We retain your account data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the Service. After account termination, we retain Customer Data for up to 30 days to allow you to export it, after which it is securely deleted. We may retain certain data for longer periods where required by law or for legitimate business purposes (e.g. billing records for 7 years as required by Singapore accounting regulations).
 </p>
 </section>

 <section id="privacy-6">
 <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">6. Data Security</h2>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
 We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data, including:
 </p>
 <ul className="mt-3 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground text-sm list-disc list-inside">
 <li>Encryption of data at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).</li>
 <li>Role-based access controls limiting data access to authorised personnel.</li>
 <li>Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.</li>
 <li>Multi-factor authentication for internal systems.</li>
 <li>Incident response procedures for security breaches.</li>
 </ul>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mt-3 text-sm">
 While we take reasonable steps to protect your data, no security system is impenetrable. In the event of a data breach affecting your personal data, we will notify you as required by applicable law.
 </p>
 </section>

 <section id="privacy-7">
 <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">7. International Data Transfers</h2>
 <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
 Fleetbase is headquartered in Singapore. Your data may be processed in Singapore and in other countries where our service providers operate. When transferring data from the EEA or UK, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission to ensure your data receives an adequate level of protection.
 </p>

 <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>

 <ul className="space-y-2 text-muted-foreground text-sm list-disc list-inside">
 <li><strong>Access</strong> — request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
 <li><strong>Rectification</strong> — request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
