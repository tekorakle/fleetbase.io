 About Fleetbase

 We built the logistics platform{' '}
 <span className="text-primary">we wished existed.</span>
 </h1>
 <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground md:text-xl">
 Fleetbase was born out of frustration. The logistics software market was dominated by
 expensive, closed-source platforms that locked operators into long contracts, charged per
 driver, and made customization impossible without paying for professional services.
 Developers who wanted to build on top of logistics infrastructure had nowhere to start —
 and operators who needed flexibility were forced into static systems with high monthly
 subscriptions and no way to adapt.
 </p>
 <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground md:text-xl">
 We believed there was a better way — a fully open-source logistics platform built for
 both <strong>developers</strong> and <strong>operators</strong> alike. One that
 developers could extend without months of custom development time, and that operators
 could deploy, own, and adapt without vendor lock-in, per-seat pricing, or black boxes.
 </p>
 <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground md:text-xl">
 That platform is Fleetbase. Founded in 2018 in Singapore, open-sourced in 2022.

 <h2 className="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight md:text-3xl">How we operate</h2>
 <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
 Fleetbase is led by two founders who built the platform from the ground up and stay
 hands-on with every part of the business — engineering, product, customer relationships,
 and partnerships. We&apos;ve grown a powerful company largely on our own, and we&apos;re
 intimately involved in the operators and businesses running on Fleetbase day to day.
 </p>
 <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
 We&apos;ve taken a bootstrapped path — that means we move on our own conviction and
 timeline — but it doesn&apos;t mean we work alone. We have full-time engineering, customer
 support, and DevOps teams behind us, delivering the SLAs, custom development, and
 operational depth our enterprise customers rely on. The founders set the direction and
 stay close to every decision; the team makes it happen at scale.
 </p>
 <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
 What this means in practice:
 </p>
 <ul className="mt-4 space-y-3 text-lg leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
 <li className="flex gap-3">
 <span className="mt-2.5 size-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-primary" />
 <span>
 <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">Direct access to the founders.</strong>{' '}
 Above the standard support tiers, the founders are personally reachable. Bug reports,
 feature requests, and partnership conversations land with the people who actually
 built the platform.
 </span>
 </li>
 <li className="flex gap-3">
 <span className="mt-2.5 size-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-primary" />
 <span>
 <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">A real team behind every release.</strong>{' '}
 Engineering, customer support, and DevOps work full-time on Fleetbase. Enterprise
 customers get dedicated support, custom development, and the same operational depth
 they&apos;d expect from any commercial platform.

 </li>
 <li className="flex gap-3">
 <span className="mt-2.5 size-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-primary" />
 <span>
 <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">A roadmap that reflects what operators need.</strong>{' '}
 We say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to features that don&apos;t fit, and &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to small,
 unglamorous fixes that make a real difference for the businesses already on the platform.
 </span>
 </li>
 <li className="flex gap-3">
 <span className="mt-2.5 size-1.5 shrink-0 rounded-full bg-primary" />
 <span>
 <strong className="font-semibold text-foreground">A platform that stays open and self-hostable.</strong>{' '}

 Fleetbase was built by two founders who bring together enterprise finance, technology,

 perspective: the rigour of enterprise systems, the discipline of military operations,
 and the pragmatism of operators who have run logistics at scale.

 Shiv is an enterprise technologist and serial entrepreneur with a background spanning
 investment banking, precious metals logistics, and technology. He began his career at
 JP Morgan at 17, working across the UK and Singapore, where he developed deep
 expertise at the intersection of financial systems and physical supply chains. He has
 10+ years of experience building and running logistics platforms across Southeast Asia.

 His experience navigating the gap between enterprise-grade logistics software and the
