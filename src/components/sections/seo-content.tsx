                Open-Source Fleet Management Software
              </h2>
              <p>
                Fleetbase is a fully open-source fleet management and transportation management system (TMS) built for logistics operators, courier services, food delivery companies, e-commerce fulfillment teams, and enterprise supply chains. Unlike proprietary fleet management platforms that charge per seat or lock you into annual contracts, Fleetbase gives you complete ownership of your data and infrastructure — deploy on your own servers or use Fleetbase Cloud.

              <p>
                The FleetOps module provides real-time order dispatch, live GPS tracking, route optimization, proof of delivery (POD), driver management, and a fully configurable order activity flow.

                Self-Hosted or Cloud Deployment
              </h2>
              <p>
                Fleetbase supports Docker, Kubernetes, and bare-metal deployment for organizations that require full data sovereignty. The self-hosted option is ideal for government agencies, healthcare providers, and enterprises operating in regulated environments. Cloud deployment on Fleetbase Cloud gives you a fully managed, auto-scaling infrastructure with zero DevOps overhead.
